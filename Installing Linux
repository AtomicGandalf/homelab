I started building my homelab by installing Linux Lite 7.4 on an old laptop.
Ran commands to update the installation to make sure it has all necessary packages.
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
Ran a command to install screen to use for configuring the Cisco network devices
  sudo apt install screen
I setup a restore point
I setup restore points daily and monthly, keeping 5 daily and 2 monthly snapshots
Then I set the theme to darkmode
